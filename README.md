# Donation Campaign

## Project Features: 
- One can search from the search bar by clicking on the search button. Remember that, you can only search by categories! 
- If one clicks on any card from the `/` route, it will redirect one to the `/donationDetails/:id` page where `:id` represents the id of the clicked donation element. Added this for making each donation details dynamic and unique one!  
- On the Statistics tab, one can see his/her donation percentage compared with total donation percentage in a pie chart! It's dynamic and with the donation, this chart updates dynamically. 
- On the donation tab, one can see his/her all donations he/she has made and when the donation length is greater than 4, a `See All` button appears there and by clicking on it, one can see his/her all donations!
